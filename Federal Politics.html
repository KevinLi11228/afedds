<p>At the first Australian Federal election in 29 March 1901, Chris was elected as the Labor candidate for the seat of Bland.</p>
<p>Also in April 1901 he became the federal parliamentary Labor Party. The good thing is, he was very influential because two other federal parliament groupings, which is the Protectionists, and the Free Traders. Although he generally prefer the Protectionists because of its similarities of policies. In addition, Labor's support to the Deakin Protectionists, they retained office and formed government following the second Federal general election on 16th December 1903.</p>
<p>He was appointed to be a Prime Minister and Treasurer on 27th April 1904, when Deakin was resigned over Labor's Amendment to his Concillation and Arbitration Bill. </p>
<p>He was commissioned to form a government, which became the first Labor government. But because of its member numbers, which only has 26, he has an impossible chance to retain the office.</p>
<p>Just like that, Watson lost office control in the space of months, based on the Socialism problem. In 17 August 1904, Chris Watson failed Prime Minister, which an amendment was passed against Arbitration bill, continued by George Reid from the Free Traders on 28th August. </p>
